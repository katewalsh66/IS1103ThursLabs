   <p>This shows how to float an image to the left of a block 
		of text. This text is in a paragraph. 
		The image is in a div tag of its own. 
		The div tag has the class 'leftfloat' applied to it. 
		View the source to see the style class. 
		The div appears in the source before this paragraph. </p>
   <p>A class, rather than a unique identifier, 
   is used so that the class can be used on more than
   one div tag. </p>
